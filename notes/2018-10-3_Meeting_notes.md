# Brando's comments + 2018-10-3 Meeting Notes

## Brando's comments

* unclear what goal is and how to measure if goal achieved
    * is goal to develop RL algorithm that asks questions?
    * how do we know if algorithm is asking good questions?
    * how do we evaluate what a good question is?
    * is there any connection between posing the question and answering the questions themselves?


## Meeting Notes

### Feedback on outline

* framing with inductive bias is good
* need to be more concrete about:
    * what we are solving
    * plan for solving it
* should cite more ongoing work
* should also address possible directions work could branch out into/possible approaches (i.e., rl or not)
* should describe potential confounding questions/problems that need to be addressed
    * e.g., several of the questions that Brando brought up
* should have contingency plan in case can't determine good metric for hypothesis posing

We can split this project into two parts: hypothesis posing and hypothesis proving. It would be difficult to accomplish the latter without first coming up with a good framework for the former, although their might be a connection between posing good questions and being able to answer the questions themselves.

### Hypothesis Posing

* establish good metric for good hypotheses
    * would be good to have a mathematically grounded definition
    * do research on information theory aspect of what is creativity/what determines good question
* is it possible to pose this as a RL problem?
* lower boundary (if can't find good metric for good hypothesis -- using crowdsourcing to find good metric could be an interesting project in itself)
* do we need to have an agent be able to solve hypotheses in order to determine if a hypothesis is good or not?
* what format should hypothesis be in -- should it be natural language or formal logic?

### Hypothesis Proving

* more existing work than hypothesis posing
    * look at gamepad
* can't really address this without finding good way to pose hypotheses first, but need to consider dependency between the two subproblems.

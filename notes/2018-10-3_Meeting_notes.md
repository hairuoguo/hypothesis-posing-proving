# Brando's comments + 2018-10-3 Meeting Notes

* unclear what goal is and how to measure if goal achieved
    * is goal to develop RL algorithm that asks questions?
    * how do we know if algorithm is asking good questions?
    * how do we evaluate what a good question is?
    * is there any connection between posing the question and answering the questions themselves?

## Brando's comments

## Meeting Notes

### Feedback on outline

* framing with inductive bias is good

### Hypothesis Posing

### Hypothesis Proving

look at gamepad

lower boundary (if can't find good metric for good hypothesis -- reinforcement learning using crowdsourcing to find good metric)

establish good metric for good hypotheses

create concrete plan with series of deliverables

address different approaches in proposal - rl or not

do we need to have an agent be able to solve hypotheses in order to determine if a hypothesis is good or not?

do research on information theory aspect of what is creativity/what determines good question

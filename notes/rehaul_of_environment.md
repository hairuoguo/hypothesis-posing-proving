* Importance of relating to the problem we care about
    * theorem proving
    * asking good hypothesis 


* getting close to the solution
* good guess how close getting to the solution
* build intuition for next state is valuable, similar to alpha go
    * figure out what is similar
* we are under the assumption rollouts are costly
    * assuming testing hypothesis is expensive, not the same in alphago
* we are working in an environment with imperfect information
    * how?
    * we aren’t necessarily know a step will move proof forward
    * running these proof assistants its expensive


* comparing questions with Lake’s definition
    * hypothesis
        * series of actions agent can make
        * at the end it gets observations from the environment
        * difference, there was an oracle that would answer every question
        * they created questions based on answers
            * from this tree of grammar
* modeling the knowledge the agent has
    * model building, how it learns about the world
    * reusing how numbers works
    * modeling relations with NNs
        * graph networks
* lake’s definition of question
    * Our approach treats questions as formal programs that, when executedon the state of the world, output an answer
* 


* roadmap for how the theorem proving environment would look like
    * what the actions would be there
    * what hypothesis would look like
    * simplify
    * principles/essence of problem

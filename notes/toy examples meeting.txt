* Important:
    * get reward at the end just like TP (Theorem Proving)
* Andy: debugging code
    * its easy to see if ur getting closer to the solution
* Hairuo: bit string
    * actions section bit string
    * reveal partial info
    * progression more clear
* Brando: picture proof outline
    * outline proof from picture library or drawing agent
    * fill small tactics with Synthesizer
    * at the end, get reward, full system
* gamepad
    * supervised data of S = { (X=proof_state,Y=distance_to_end)}
* why we introduce the progress forward
* Verification
    * Dafny
        * https://rise4fun.com/Dafny/tutorial
    * SMT, Z3
* think about several bit string environment to test
    * TODO: Brando write down all aspects of theorem proving
        * send document to team
        * then they can start thinking about different bit string environments that test different aspects of this problem
